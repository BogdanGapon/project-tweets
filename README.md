# My project-tweets

Project build on Vite (https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

Project-tweets it's the `React` project where you have cards of users which you
can follow to any of users you liked.

When I created this App I use `mockapi` (https://mockapi.io/projects) backend to
save users over there and fetch it when I need to show them on screen. By the
way whenever you follow on user and refresh the page your following will save at
the backend.
